 Many files are just there to keep a record rather than being actively used. The relavent ones are:
 'functionsMCF.nb': defines everything needed to calculate a2,
 'RivannaMCF.nb': uses the function in 'functionsMCF.nb' to do the calculation. 
 'Quartic D Matrices.nb': calculates the matrices needed by functionsMCF.
